# Coded-ResNeXt
Code used in the  Coded ResNeXt paper (Coded_ResNeXt.pdf). There are two folders, CIFAR and Imagenet, containing our code for the corresponding datasets. 
To train our models we used the accelarators of Google COLAB. Therefore we include also in each folder a jupiter notebook which gives the possibility to be open by Google COLAB. More information for each dataset on the README.md file of each folder.
